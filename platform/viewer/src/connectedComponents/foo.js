export const text= `CLINICAL HISTORY:
Routine examination in a 46 year-old lady. 2 children, first pregnancy at the age of 37 years.
Family history of breast cancer (Mother at 65 years).
TECHNIQUE:
Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views.
COMPARISON: October 22, 2019.
FINDINGS:
The fibroglandular tissues are moderately dense.
Stable 5 mm well-circumscribed benign-looking opacity in the mid outer quadrant of the left
breast, also seen on ultrasound, corresponding to a benign intramammary lymph node.
No spiculated lesion, architectural distortion or focal abnormal density is seen.
No cluster of microcalcifications is detected.
No skin thickening is seen.
The breast ultrasound, which was done due to the breast high density, did not reveal the
presence of any focal suspicious lesion in either breast. There is a benign intramammary lymph
node measuring 5 mm in the mid outer quadrant of the left breast.

CONCLUSION:
No evidence of suspicious lesion is seen. No significant change is seen since the previous
examination done on October 22, 2019.
ACR 2 Type III.
